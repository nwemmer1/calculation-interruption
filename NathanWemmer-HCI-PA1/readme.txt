HCI Programming Assignment 1
Linux 

Instructions to run program:
There is a makefile included with each part of the project.
Type 'make' to compile the project,.
Type './pa1' to start the program.

In Part 2:
While working on programming assignment 2, I learned a lot about packages that are 
exclusive to certain operating systems. My first problem, that you mentioned in class, 
is that the peek function was not working the way it was thought to. To go around this, 
I attempted using the <windows.h> library and the <conio.h>. Installing these to my 
computer was hard because I use an Ubuntu Virtual Machine. I have everything laid out 
and commented out that does not work, but the methods are there and should be right 
after studying the documentation for the header files and methods.
